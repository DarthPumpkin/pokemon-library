# What it is
This library provides a starting point for all future pokemon implementations. It is designed to take a bunch of effort off the game developer, be straight-forward and easy to use.

# Current state
Still early but constantly growing.

# How to run
No dependencies, no gradle, just go for it: Clone the repo and run the JUnit Test Suite `de.darthpumpkin.pkmnlib.test.AllTests`. Currently, testing and extending focus is on the Pokemon classes `PokemonSpecies`, `PokemonInstance`, `PokmeonBattleInstance` and their respective factories and builders.

# How to contribute
Pick one of the code lines that are marked with `// TODO` and implement the missing functionality. Currently, you will find most of these in `de.darthpumpkin.pkmnlib.battle.RegularBattle`. Don't forget to submit the pull requests.

Of course any other contribution is appreciated, too!
