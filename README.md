# What it is
This library provides a starting point for all future pokemon implementations. Possibilities are endless and perhaps I will do my own once I have time for that. It is designed to take a bunch of effort off the game developer, be straight-forward, easy to use and generally pretty badass.

# What it is not
A fully functional game.

# Current state
Still early but constantly growing.

# How to help
Pick one of the code lines that are marked with `// TODO` and implement the missing functionality. Currently, you will find most of these in `de.darthpumpkin.pkmnlib.battle.RegularBattle`. Don't forget to submit the pull requests.

Of course any other help is appreciated, too!
