What it is
===============

This library provides a starting point for all future pokemon implementations. Possibilities are endless and perhaps I will do my own once I have time for that. It is designed to take a bunch of effort off the game developer, be straight-forward, easy to use and generally pretty badass.

What it is not
==============
A fully functional game.

Current state
===============
very very early. So early, it doesn't even actually make sense to write about its current state.

Other
===============
Help is always appreciated
